# PHP_MySQL
Tinkering around with PHP and MySQL files...
I've have been asssigned a couple of tasks...
At the moment I'm trying to import a CSV file into MySql using php, but before I insert the data into the table,
I want to set the name and surname feild to be capitlised, and the email feild to be set to lowercasde before inserting.
