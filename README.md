# PHP_MySQL
Tinkering around with PHP and MySQL files...

I've have been asssigned a couple of tasks...

At the moment I'm trying to import a CSV file (users.csv) into MySql with a table called "users" using php (user_upload.php)
but before I insert the data into the table,
I want to set the name and surname feild to be capitlised, and the email feild to be set to lowercasde before inserting.

I'm thinking there's a couple of CREATE TRIGGER... BEFORE scripts in the MySQL. 
feeling a little bit disoriented.

Added more code to the user_upload file...looks like a dog's breakfast

...sigh.
